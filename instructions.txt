4 in a row
==========
Each player on their turn places their symbol in any one of the
seven columns in the frame. Play then passes to the other player.
Play continues this way until one player achieves a row of 4 of
their symbols, in which case they have won the game, or until no row of
4 is possible in which case the game is a draw.
